## Migration Guide: v1.x to v2.x

Version 2.0 represents a complete rewrite of the library to align with the official Figma REST API specifications. Here are the key breaking changes:

### Method Signatures
**Before (v1.x):**
```javascript
api.getFile(fileKey, { version, ids, depth, geometry, plugin_data, branch_data })
```

**After (v2.x):**
```javascript
api.getFile(
  { file_key: fileKey }, // pathParams
  { version, ids, depth, geometry, plugin_data, branch_data } // queryParams
)
```

### Authentication
OAuth authentication has been updated to follow the new Figma specifications. The `oAuthToken` method signature has changed.

### Benefits of v2.x
- Full type safety with official Figma API types
- Complete API coverage with all endpoints
- Future-proof alignment with Figma's specifications
- Better error handling and debugging
